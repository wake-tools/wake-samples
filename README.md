# ðŸ§© Wake-Samples

A collection of **JIT C (.jc)** demos running instantly with **Wake** â€”  
no build system, no waiting, just **code â†’ run**.

All examples are adapted from the official **Sokol samples** (zlib/libpng license)  
and converted to Wakeâ€™s live runtime environment with **memory bound checking**,  
**hot reload**, and **debug UI** support.

---

If **Wake** is installed, you can **double-click any `.jc` file** to launch it directly,  
or run it from the command line:

## ðŸš€ Run a Sample

```bash
# From the sample folder
wake clear-sapp.jc
wake cube-sapp.jc
